### 🔧 Final Resolution: Static Asset Loading Crisis

**Problem:** JavaScript and CSS chunks were failing to load on the signup page, causing client-side exceptions and 404 errors.

**Root Cause:** Webpack chunk naming mismatch between build and runtime, likely due to build cache corruption.

**Solution:** 
- Cleared Next.js build cache (`.next` directory)
- Performed clean rebuild with `npm run build`
- Deployed fresh build to production

**Result:** All static assets now loading correctly with 200 status codes.
